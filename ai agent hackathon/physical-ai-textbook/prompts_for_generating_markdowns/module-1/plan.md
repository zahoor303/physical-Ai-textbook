You are helping me create a detailed PROJECT PLAN for writing Module 1: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" content based on the specification we established.

## Context:
This plan is ONLY for creating Module 1 content. We have ~30 hours total for the entire hackathon, and Module 1 should take approximately 6-8 hours to complete.

## What We Have:
- **Specification** (spec.md): Detailed requirements for Module 1 chapters, structure, code examples, exercises
- **Constitution**: Overall writing standards and principles
- **Goal**: Create high-quality, beginner-friendly ROS 2 educational content

## Create a DETAILED EXECUTION PLAN for Module 1:

### 1. Time Allocation
Break down the 6-8 hours into phases:
- Setup and structure creation: X hours
- Content writing: X hours
- Code examples development: X hours
- Diagrams creation: X hours
- Exercises and assessments: X hours
- Review and polish: X hours

### 2. Chapter Creation Order
Based on the spec, we have 7 chapters for Module 1. Define the order to write them:

**Priority 1 (Must Complete - Core Learning):**
- Chapter X: [Title] - [Time estimate] - [Why this first]

**Priority 2 (Should Complete - Important):**
- Chapter Y: [Title] - [Time estimate]

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have - Can be minimal if time runs short):**
- Chapter Z: [Title] - [Time estimate]

Explain the reasoning behind this order (dependencies, complexity, importance).

### 3. Detailed Chapter-by-Chapter Plan

For each of the 7 chapters, create a mini-plan:

#### Chapter 1: [Title from spec]
**Time Allocated:** X minutes
**Objectives:**
- Write introduction (15 min)
- Explain core concepts (30 min)
- Create code example 1 (20 min)
- Create code example 2 (20 min)
- Write exercises (15 min)
- Create diagram (20 min)
- Write summary (10 min)

**Dependencies:** None (foundational chapter)
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Complete markdown file
- [ ] 2-3 working code examples
- [ ] 1 Mermaid diagram
- [ ] 3 exercises

#### Chapter 2: [Title from spec]
[Repeat structure above]

...continue for all 7 chapters

### 4. Content Generation Strategy

**Approach for each chapter:**
1. **Outline first** (5 min) - Structure the chapter
2. **Write introduction** (10-15 min) - Hook the reader
3. **Explain concepts** (20-30 min) - Core teaching
4. **Code examples** (15-25 min per example) - Practical learning
5. **Create diagrams** (15-20 min) - Visual aids
6. **Write exercises** (10-15 min) - Practice opportunities
7. **Summary** (5-10 min) - Reinforce learning
8. **Quick review** (5 min) - Check quality

**Tools to use:**
- Claude Code for content generation
- Mermaid for diagrams
- VS Code for code testing (if possible)

### 5. Code Examples Development Plan

For Module 1, we need approximately 14-21 code examples (2-3 per chapter).

**Code Example Creation Process:**
1. Define what concept it demonstrates
2. Write minimal working code
3. Add detailed comments
4. Test if possible (or mark as "untested example")
5. Show expected output
6. Explain key points

**Time per code example:** 15-20 minutes

**Examples needed:**
- Chapter 1: Simple ROS 2 node, Hello World publisher
- Chapter 2: Publisher-Subscriber example
- Chapter 3: Service client-server
- [Continue for all chapters based on spec]

### 6. Diagram Creation Plan

Based on spec, we need approximately 7-10 diagrams for Module 1.

**Diagrams to create:**
1. ROS 2 architecture overview (Mermaid - flowchart)
2. Node communication diagram (Mermaid - graph)
3. Topic pub/sub visualization (Mermaid - sequence)
4. Service request/response flow (Mermaid - sequence)
5. URDF structure hierarchy (Mermaid - graph)
[Add more based on spec]

**Time per diagram:** 15-20 minutes
**Total time for diagrams:** ~2 hours

### 7. File Structure Setup

**Before writing content, create:**
```
docs/module-1/
├── _category_.json
├── 01-introduction-to-ros2.md (template ready)
├── 02-ros2-nodes.md (template ready)
├── 03-topics-and-publishers.md (template ready)
├── 04-services.md (template ready)
├── 05-actions.md (template ready)
├── 06-urdf-basics.md (template ready)
└── 07-python-rclpy-integration.md (template ready)
```

**Time for setup:** 30 minutes

### 8. Quality Checkpoints

**After every 2 chapters, perform:**
- [ ] Technical accuracy check
- [ ] Beginner-friendliness review
- [ ] Code example validation
- [ ] Consistent formatting check
- [ ] Learning objectives alignment

**Time per checkpoint:** 15 minutes

### 9. Parallel Work Opportunities

What can be done simultaneously (if using multiple tools/sessions):
- Writing chapter text while generating code examples
- Creating diagrams while reviewing previous chapters
- Outlining next chapter while polishing current one

### 10. Risk Management for Module 1

**Potential Issues:**
- Code examples might not work (no testing environment)
  - **Mitigation:** Mark as "illustrative examples", add disclaimers
  
- Running out of time
  - **Mitigation:** Priority system (focus on Priority 1 chapters)
  
- Inconsistent quality across chapters
  - **Mitigation:** Use chapter template strictly, regular checkpoints

- Complex concepts hard to explain simply
  - **Mitigation:** Use analogies, break into smaller pieces

### 11. Hour-by-Hour Timeline (Example for 8-hour allocation)

**Hour 0-1: Setup**
- Create folder structure
- Set up chapter templates
- Create _category_.json

**Hour 1-2: Chapter 1**
- Write complete Chapter 1
- Create 2 code examples
- Create 1 diagram

**Hour 2-3: Chapter 2**
- Write complete Chapter 2
- Create 2-3 code examples
- Create 1 diagram

**Hour 3-4: Chapter 3**
[Continue pattern]

**Hour 4-5: Chapter 4**
[Continue pattern]

**Hour 5-6: Chapters 5-6 (faster, building on pattern)**

**Hour 6-7: Chapter 7**

**Hour 7-8: Review, polish, final checks**

### 12. Success Criteria for Module 1

**Minimum Viable Module (Must Have):**
- [ ] All 7 chapters created
- [ ] Each chapter has introduction and core concepts
- [ ] At least 1 code example per chapter
- [ ] Module overview complete
- [ ] Consistent formatting

**Good Module (Should Have):**
- [ ] 2-3 code examples per chapter
- [ ] Diagrams in most chapters
- [ ] Exercises in all chapters
- [ ] Summaries written

**Excellent Module (Nice to Have):**
- [ ] All code examples tested/validated
- [ ] High-quality diagrams in every chapter
- [ ] Multiple exercises per chapter
- [ ] Further reading resources
- [ ] Polished prose

### 13. Subagent Usage Plan (Bonus Points)

If creating ROS2_Expert subagent:
- When to activate it: For all chapter content
- What skills it needs: ChapterFormat, CodeExample, DiagramCreation
- How it saves time: Consistent output, faster generation

**Subagent creation time:** 30 minutes
**Time saved:** 1-2 hours over manual generation

### 14. Next Steps After Module 1

Once Module 1 is complete:
- [ ] Commit to GitHub
- [ ] Move to Module 2 (or chatbot if doing parallel development)
- [ ] Document any lessons learned
- [ ] Adjust timeline for remaining modules

Think step by step and create a realistic, achievable plan that accounts for:
- Time constraints
- Quality requirements
- Learning curve (chapters get faster as you build momentum)
- Need for breaks
- Potential issues

Output as a detailed markdown document with:
- Clear timeline
- Task breakdowns
- Checkboxes for tracking
- Time estimates
- Priority levels
- Risk mitigation strategies
