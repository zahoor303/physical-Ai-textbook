You are helping me create a comprehensive textbook on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" using Docusaurus. This textbook will be published online with an embedded RAG chatbot for interactive learning.

Create a CONSTITUTION document that defines the core principles, rules, and standards for this entire project.

## Project Context:
- **Target Audience**: Students learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics (beginner to intermediate level)
- **Format**: Online interactive textbook built with Docusaurus
- **Content**: 4 modules covering ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action
- **Special Features**: Embedded AI chatbot, code examples, diagrams, exercises

## Constitution Should Include:

### 1. Content Principles
- Writing style and tone (e.g., beginner-friendly, technical but accessible)
- How complex concepts should be explained
- Use of analogies and real-world examples
- Depth vs breadth balance

### 2. Structure Standards
- Chapter organization format
- Required sections in every chapter (intro, concepts, examples, exercises, summary)
- Naming conventions for files and folders
- Sidebar/navigation structure

### 3. Code Standards
- Programming languages used (Python, C++)
- Code commenting requirements
- Code block formatting
- Testing and validation expectations

### 4. Visual Standards
- Diagram requirements (Mermaid, images)
- When to use visuals vs text
- Image naming and organization
- Accessibility considerations

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Exercise types and difficulty levels
- Hands-on project requirements
- Chatbot integration points
- User engagement strategies

### 6. Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy requirements
- Peer review process
- Consistency checks
- Update and maintenance guidelines

### 7. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Language clarity requirements
- Support for different learning styles
- Hardware requirement considerations
- Making content available for various skill levels

Create a comprehensive constitution document that will guide the creation of all content in this textbook. Make it detailed enough to ensure consistency but flexible enough to allow creative teaching methods.
