# Implementation Plan: ROS 2 Services Module

**Branch**: `003-ros2-services-module` | **Date**: 2025-11-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `D:\physical-ai-textbook\specs\003-ros2-services-module\spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of a new educational module, "ROS 2 Services," for the Physical AI Textbook. The module will introduce students to the request-response communication pattern in ROS 2. The technical approach involves creating Markdown content with detailed explanations and providing practical, working code examples in both C++ and Python. The module will also cover the use of command-line tools for interacting with services.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, Python 3.8+, C++17
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3, React, ROS 2 Humble
**Storage**: Markdown files in the git repository.
**Testing**: Manual QA: code example validation, clarity of explanations.
**Target Platform**: Web (Docusaurus website), ROS 2 Humble (for code examples).
**Project Type**: Documentation website (Docusaurus).
**Performance Goals**: N/A (focus on content quality and clarity).
**Constraints**: Limited time due to hackathon context; module should be modular and chapters prioritized.
**Scale/Scope**: One new module in the textbook, consisting of ~3-4 chapters.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Library-First**: COMPLIANT. The new module is a self-contained, independently valuable unit of content.
- **II. CLI Interface**: COMPLIANT. The development workflow is managed through `speckit.*` CLI commands.
- **III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: MINOR DEVIATION. Formal TDD is not being applied to the creation of educational content. However, a quality assurance phase is planned to validate all code examples and exercises.
- **IV. Integration Testing**: N/A. This feature is focused on content generation and does not involve inter-service communication that would require integration testing.
- **V. Simplicity**: COMPLIANT. The plan emphasizes a modular structure, allowing chapters to be developed independently. This aligns with the YAGNI principle.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
specs/003-ros2-services-module/
├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The new content will be added to the `docs` directory, following the existing structure for modules. Code examples will be stored in the `static` directory.

```text
docs/
└── module-2-services/
    ├── _category_.json
    ├── 01-introduction-to-services.md
    ├── 02-creating-a-service.md
    ├── 03-creating-a-client.md
    └── 04-services-in-practice.md

static/
└── code-examples/
    └── module-2-services/
        ├── cpp_service_server.cpp
        ├── py_service_server.py
        ├── cpp_service_client.cpp
        └── py_service_client.py
```

**Structure Decision**: A new directory `docs/module-2-services` will be created to house the markdown files for the new educational module. A corresponding `static/code-examples/module-2-services` directory will store the source code for the C++ and Python examples. This keeps the new content organized and separate from other modules.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **III. Test-First**: Minor Deviation | The feature is the creation of educational content (markdown files and code snippets). Applying a strict TDD red-green-refactor cycle is not practical for writing prose and simple, illustrative code examples. | A full TDD approach would require creating a complex testing framework for parsing markdown and validating educational concepts, which is overkill for this project's scope and timeline. The planned manual QA phase is a simpler, more effective way to ensure the quality of the content. |
