# Feature Specification: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Content

**Feature Branch**: `002-module-1-ros2-content`
**Created**: 2025-11-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create comprehensive Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) educational content with 7 chapters covering ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, services, actions, URDF, and Python AI agent integration"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Beginner Learning ROS 2 Basics (Priority: P1)

A complete beginner with basic Python knowledge (but no robotics experience) wants to understand how robot software works. They start with Module 1, Chapter 1, and learn what ROS 2 is and why it's important. They progress through understanding nodes and topics, running their first "Hello World" ROS 2 node, and seeing messages flow between processes. By the end of Chapters 1-3, they can create simple publisher and subscriber nodes that communicate.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational content that every student must complete. Without understanding nodes and topics, students cannot progress to any advanced concepts. This represents the minimum viable learning path for ROS 2.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student with zero robotics knowledge complete Chapters 1-3, successfully run all code examples, and create a working publisher-subscriber system that demonstrates message passing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student opens Chapter 1, **When** they read the introduction, **Then** they understand what ROS 2 is, why it exists, and see a clear architecture diagram
2. **Given** a student reaches a code example in Chapter 2, **When** they copy the node creation code, **Then** it executes successfully and produces expected output matching documentation
3. **Given** a student completes Chapter 3 exercise, **When** they modify the publisher frequency from 1Hz to 10Hz, **Then** they observe the changed behavior and understand the concept
4. **Given** a student struggles with topics, **When** they refer to the Mermaid diagram, **Then** they visualize the pub/sub pattern and grasp the concept

---

### User Story 2 - Learning Request/Response Patterns (Priority: P2)

A student who completed the publisher/subscriber chapters wants to learn synchronous communication for scenarios like querying robot status or triggering specific actions. They work through Chapter 4 on Services, learning when to use services vs topics, implementing a simple calculator service, and calling services from command-line tools. They understand the request/response paradigm.

**Why this priority**: Services are essential for robot control (e.g., starting/stopping behaviors, requesting data), but students can learn core ROS 2 concepts without them initially. This builds on P1 content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying a student can create a service server, make requests from a client, handle responses, and explain when to use services vs topics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student opens Chapter 4, **When** they read the services introduction, **Then** they see a comparison table: "Use topics when..., Use services when..."
2. **Given** a student runs the add_two_ints service example, **When** they call the service with parameters (3, 5), **Then** they receive response 8 and understand synchronous communication
3. **Given** a student attempts the intermediate exercise, **When** they create a service that queries robot battery level, **Then** the service responds with a mock percentage value

---

### User Story 3 - Managing Long-Running Tasks with Actions (Priority: P3)

An intermediate student wants to command a robot to perform complex, long-running tasks (like navigating to a goal) with progress feedback and cancellation capability. They study Chapter 5 on Actions, understanding the goal-feedback-result pattern, implementing a simple countdown action server, and visualizing action states.

**Why this priority**: Actions are advanced and specific to complex robotics tasks. Students can build simple robots without understanding actions. This is valuable but not essential for foundational learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a student create an action server, send goals from a client, receive periodic feedback, and demonstrate goal cancellation mid-execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads Chapter 5, **When** they see the state machine diagram, **Then** they understand action lifecycle (PENDING → ACTIVE → SUCCEEDED/ABORTED/CANCELED)
2. **Given** a student runs the countdown action example, **When** they send a goal of 10 seconds, **Then** they receive feedback every second showing remaining time
3. **Given** an action is running, **When** the student cancels it mid-execution, **Then** the action transitions to CANCELED state and cleanup occurs

---

### User Story 4 - Describing Robot Structure with URDF (Priority: P4)

A student wants to define their robot's physical structure (links, joints, sensors) so it can be visualized in RViz and simulated in Gazebo. They learn URDF XML structure in Chapter 6, create a simple 2-link robot arm, visualize it, and understand coordinate frames.

**Why this priority**: URDF is important for simulation but not required for basic ROS 2 programming. Students can learn messaging and communication without knowing URDF initially. This enables visualization but isn't core to ROS 2 concepts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a student write a valid URDF file for a simple robot, launch RViz to visualize it, and explain parent-child link relationships.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student opens Chapter 6, **When** they see the URDF structure explanation, **Then** they understand links (rigid bodies), joints (connections), and coordinate frames
2. **Given** a student creates a 2-link robot URDF, **When** they launch `ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py`, **Then** RViz opens showing the robot with movable joint sliders
3. **Given** a student modifies a joint type from `revolute` to `prismatic`, **When** they reload in RViz, **Then** they observe the changed motion behavior

---

### User Story 5 - Bridging AI Agents to ROS 2 Controllers (Priority: P5)

An advanced student wants to connect Python AI code (like an LLM-powered planner or reinforcement learning agent) to ROS 2 robot controllers. They work through Chapter 7, learning rclpy in depth, creating hybrid nodes that run AI inference and publish control commands, and managing threading/async patterns.

**Why this priority**: This is the most advanced topic, bridging AI and robotics. It requires understanding all previous chapters. While exciting for the "Physical AI" theme, it's not essential for learning ROS 2 fundamentals and represents advanced integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a student create a Python AI agent (simple rule-based or mock LLM) that subscribes to sensor data, processes it, and publishes motor commands via ROS 2.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads Chapter 7 introduction, **When** they see the architecture diagram, **Then** they understand the AI agent loop: sense (ROS 2 subscribe) → think (AI process) → act (ROS 2 publish)
2. **Given** a student implements the example AI agent, **When** they receive laser scan data on `/scan` topic, **Then** the agent processes it and publishes velocity commands on `/cmd_vel`
3. **Given** the AI agent uses async/await, **When** they handle concurrent ROS callbacks and AI inference, **Then** they avoid blocking and maintain real-time responsiveness

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student's local ROS 2 installation version doesn't match the specified Humble version? **Chapter prerequisites include environment validation; students see clear error messages pointing to installation troubleshooting guide in Chapter 1.**
- How does the content handle students who skip chapters and jump to advanced topics? **Each chapter states prerequisites explicitly; code examples will fail with clear error messages if dependencies aren't met, redirecting students to earlier chapters.**
- What if code examples fail due to package updates after content is published? **Version numbers are pinned in all examples (ros2:humble, rclpy==3.3.7); deprecation notices added when APIs change; rolling update changelog tracks all modifications.**
- How are students without physical robots or Ubuntu 22.04 machines supported? **All examples work in Docker containers; Chapter 1 includes containerized setup instructions; examples use simulated/mock data where hardware isn't essential.**
- What if students don't understand Mermaid diagram notation? **Chapter 1 includes a "Reading Diagrams" sidebar explaining Mermaid syntax; first diagram in each chapter has annotations.**
- How does content handle varying student learning speeds? **Estimated completion times are guidelines; chapters are self-contained; advanced "Going Deeper" sections are clearly marked as optional.**

## Assumptions

1. **Student Background**: Students have completed basic Python programming (variables, functions, loops, classes) but have no robotics or ROS experience
2. **Development Environment**: Students have access to Ubuntu 22.04 (native, VM, or WSL2) or can use Docker containers with ROS 2 Humble pre-installed
3. **Hardware**: No physical robot required; all examples work with simulated/mock data or ROS 2 command-line tools
4. **Time Commitment**: Self-directed learners can dedicate 8-12 hours total to complete Module 1 over 1-2 weeks
5. **Internet Access**: Students have reliable internet for installing packages (apt, pip) and accessing external documentation links
6. **Learning Style**: Content supports text-based learners; visual learners benefit from Mermaid diagrams; kinesthetic learners engage via hands-on exercises
7. **Language**: All content is in English; code comments use English; terminal output is English (default ROS 2 locale)
8. **Update Frequency**: Module 1 content will be reviewed annually or when ROS 2 Humble transitions to a new LTS version
9. **Support**: Students can use the chatbot for clarifications but the content must be self-sufficient for offline learning
10. **Prior Modules**: This is the first module; no dependencies on other modules (but feeds into Module 2: Simulation)

## Dependencies

- **ROS 2 Humble LTS**: All code examples and documentation references assume ROS 2 Humble (not Foxy, Galactic, or Rolling)
- **Python 3.10+**: Required for code examples; specific version compatibility with rclpy 3.3.x
- **Docusaurus 3.x**: Content is written in Markdown/MDX following Docusaurus conventions
- **Mermaid.js**: All diagrams use Mermaid syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines
- **Official ROS 2 Documentation**: External links point to docs.ros.org/en/humble/ for reference material
- **Constitution**: Content must comply with all 7 principles defined in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- **Chatbot Backend**: (Optional) Chatbot can answer questions about Module 1 content via RAG over published chapters
- **Existing Project Structure**: Integrates with overall textbook in `docs/module-1/` directory alongside other modules

## Out of Scope

- **Module 2-4 Content**: This spec covers only Module 1; Simulation, Isaac, and VLA modules are separate specifications
- **Chatbot Integration**: The chatbot itself (RAG system, FastAPI backend) is part of the main textbook feature, not this content spec
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages deployment and CI/CD are handled by the main textbook infrastructure
- **Quiz System**: Module-level quizzes are part of the main textbook's assessment feature; this spec focuses on chapter-level exercises
- **Advanced ROS 2 Topics**: Excludes DDS configuration, security, real-time scheduling, custom middleware—these are advanced topics beyond beginner scope
- **C++ Examples**: Module 1 uses Python exclusively; C++ ROS 2 programming is out of scope
- **Physical Robot Hardware**: No instructions for purchasing, assembling, or wiring physical robots; simulation-only approach
- **ROS 1 (Legacy)**: No ROS 1 content, comparisons, or migration guides; pure ROS 2 focus
- **Third-Party Tutorials**: Content is original; does not embed external tutorials or videos (only links in "Further Reading")
- **Multi-Language Support**: Content is English-only; Urdu translation (if needed) is handled at the chatbot level, not content level
