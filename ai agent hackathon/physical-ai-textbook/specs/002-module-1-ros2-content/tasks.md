# Tasks: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Content

**Input**: Design documents from `D:\physical-ai-textbook\specs\002-module-1-ros2-content\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), constitution.md

**Tests**: Not applicable - this is educational content creation, not software development

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (learning paths) to enable independent chapter creation and validation. Each user story corresponds to a learning milestone that can be tested with students.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different chapters/files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Educational content**: `docs/module-1/` at repository root
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` for reusable templates
- **Static assets**: `static/img/module-1/` (if needed)

- [ ] T006 [P] Review `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for educational content principles

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core templates and validation setup that ALL chapters depend on

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No chapter writing can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Define consistent Mermaid color scheme in plan (blue: publishers, green: subscribers, orange: services, purple: actions)
- [ ] T008 Create ROS 2 code linting setup instructions (black formatter, flake8 configuration for PEP 8)
- [ ] T009 Test Mermaid rendering in Docusaurus (create sample diagram, verify it displays correctly)
- [ ] T010 Validate WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for chosen Mermaid color scheme using contrast checker

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - chapter implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all chapter creation
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 - P1 (Chapters 1-3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories - **THIS IS THE MVP**
- **User Story 2 - P2 (Chapter 4)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on Chapter 3 concepts for comparison
- **User Story 3 - P3 (Chapter 5)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on Chapters 3-4 for context
- **User Story 4 - P4 (Chapter 6)**: Can start after Foundational - Only depends on Chapter 1, independent of US2/US3
- **User Story 5 - P5 (Chapter 7)**: Can start after Foundational - Ideally after all others but minimum Chapters 2-3

### Within Each User Story (Chapter)

- Frontmatter and structure creation first
- Learning objectives before content sections
- Introduction before core concepts
- Core concepts before code examples (concepts inform examples)
- Code examples before exercises (exercises build on examples)
- Exercises before common pitfalls (pitfalls address exercise issues)
- Summary last (summarizes all preceding content)
- Validation after chapter completion

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup):**
- T003, T004, T005, T006 can all run in parallel (reviewing different skills)

**Phase 2 (Foundational):**
- T007, T008, T009, T010 can run in parallel once Setup is done

**Phase 3 (US1 - Chapters 1-3):**
- Once Chapter 1 tasks (T011-T021) are complete, Chapter 2 (T022-T032) and Chapter 3 (T033-T043) can be created in parallel since they're different files
- Within Chapter 1: T011 (create file) must complete before other tasks, but T015 (diagram), T016 (code example 1), T017 (exercise) can happen in parallel after T014 (core concepts) completes

**Phase 4 (US2 - Chapter 4):**
- T049-T061 are sequential within the chapter

**Phase 5 (US3 - Chapter 5):**
- Can start in parallel with Phase 4 if team capacity allows (T062-T072 work on different file than Chapter 4)

**Phase 6 (US4 - Chapter 6):**
- Can start in parallel with Phases 4-5 (T073-T083 independent)

**Phase 7 (US5 - Chapter 7):**
- Can start in parallel with Phases 4-6 (T084-T094 independent)

**Phase 8 (Polish):**
- T095, T096, T099, T100, T101, T104 can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Chapters 1-3)

```bash
# After Foundation is complete, launch all 3 chapters in parallel:
Task: "Create Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2" (T011-T021)
Task: "Create Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes" (T022-T032)
Task: "Create Chapter 3: Topics and Publishers" (T033-T043)

# Or within Chapter 1, after core concepts (T014) completes:
Task: "Create Mermaid architecture diagram" (T015)
Task: "Write Code Example 1: Hello World node" (T016)
Task: "Write exercise: Modify Hello World" (T017)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Chapters 1-3)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T010) - CRITICAL, blocks all chapters
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Chapters 1-3 (T011-T048)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Chapters 1-3 with beginner student
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this provides foundational ROS 2 learning

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Templates and standards ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Chapters 1-3) → Test with students → Deploy (MVP! - Beginner ROS 2 path complete)
3. Add User Story 2 (Chapter 4) → Test independently → Deploy (Services added)
4. Add User Story 3 (Chapter 5) → Test independently → Deploy (Actions added)
5. Add User Story 4 (Chapter 6) → Test independently → Deploy (URDF added)
6. Add User Story 5 (Chapter 7) → Test independently → Deploy (AI integration added)
7. Polish → Final module complete

Each user story adds value without breaking previous stories. Students can stop at any checkpoint.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple content creators:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T010)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Creator A: User Story 1 - Chapters 1-3 (T011-T048)
   - Creator B: User Story 2 - Chapter 4 (T049-T061)
   - Creator C: User Story 4 - Chapter 6 (T073-T083)
3. Later:
   - Creator D: User Story 3 - Chapter 5 (T062-T072)
   - Creator E: User Story 5 - Chapter 7 (T084-T094)
4. All creators: Polish together (T095-T105)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files/chapters, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific learning milestone for traceability
- Each user story (learning path) should be independently completable and testable with students
- Follow all three skills strictly: chapter-format, code-example-format, exercise-creation-format
- All code examples must target ROS 2 Humble (not Foxy/Galactic/Rolling)
- Commit after each chapter or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate content with beta students
- Avoid: vague content, inconsistent terminology, skipping quality checks
- Success metrics: Students complete chapters in estimated time ± 20%, code examples run successfully, exercises have clear success criteria
